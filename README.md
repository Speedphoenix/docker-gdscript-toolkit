# docker-gdscript-toolkit
Docker container that has the godot and godot-gdscript-toolkit by Scony installed

This docker container has [Scony/godot-gdscript-toolkit](https://github.com/Scony/godot-gdscript-toolkit) and godot installed in `/usr/local/bin`

It uses the [vayan's godot docker builds](https://github.com/vayan/docker-godot)

I use this docker image mostly for CI with GitHub actions
